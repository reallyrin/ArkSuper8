2. Write the Raspberry Pi Os (Legacy, 32-bit) debian bullseye image into your sd card for the raspberry pi and make sure for the 3.5 LCD screen to follow instructions from https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/interfacing-3.5-inch-touchscreen-tft-lcd-with-raspberry-pi
3. To connect to the printer, use the usb cable it comes with. To connect to power use a 12v dc power cable supply and the power cable the printer came with and connect both by a 12v dv power connector.

    - sudo apt install python3-picamera
    - sudo apt install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk
    - sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    - pip install opencv-python-headless opencv-python pillow
4. Test the printer works, in the Terminal, go through these steps:
    - ls -l /dev/usb/lp0
    - sudo chmod 777 /dev/usb/lp0
    - eche -e "This is a test.\\n\\n\\n" > /dev/usb/lp0
